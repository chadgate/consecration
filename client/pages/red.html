                <h4>All Things Common in Ancient Times</h4>
                <p>
                    In ancient times groups of righteous saints practiced 
                    the strategy of “all things common”. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the new testament on the day of Pentecost the Holy 
                    Spirit was poured out and Peter testifies of Jesus’s 
                    resurrection. The people’s hearts were pricked by the 
                    Holy Ghost and they asked Peter what they should do. 
                    Peter responded that they should repent and be baptized, 
                    and that day 3000 souls were baptized. Afterwards it says, 
                    “And all that believed were together, and had all things 
                    common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted 
                    them to all men, as every man had need (Acts 2:44:45). I 
                    do not know whether having all things common among them 
                    was a policy of the church at this time, or if they simply
                    did it out of the goodness of their heart. The point is 
                    that they were able to rise above personal selfishness 
                    and give of what they had to help those around them who 
                    had less. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Book of Mormon after the visitation of Jesus 
                    Christ the people lived very happily. The wicked had 
                    been destroyed in the natural disasters and destruction 
                    that followed Christ’s death on the cross, and the 
                    righteous had spent a good period of time being taught 
                    by the Savior Himself. In Fourth Nephi it records that, 
                    “the people were all converted unto the Lord” (4 Nephi 
                    1:2). All were striving to live the gospel as they had 
                    just been instructed, and as part of that “they had all 
                    things common among them; therefore there were not rich 
                    and poor, bond and free” (4 Nephi 1:3).  Later Mormon says, 
                    “…and surely there could not be a happier people among all 
                    the people who had been created by the hand of God.” (4 
                    Nephi 1:16). I am sure that their love for their neighbors
                    and their selflessness played a large roll in creating 
                    such a happy people.
