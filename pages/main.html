                    The LDS Guide to the Scriptures defines consecration saying, 
                    "The law of consecration is a divine principle whereby men 
                    and women voluntarily dedicate their time, talents, and 
                    material wealth to the establishment and building up of God’s kingdom" (
                    <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/consecrate-law-of-consecration">LDS Guide to the Scriptures</a>
                    ). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oftentimes when we, as members of the LDS church, think about consecration we picture giving everything we own to the Bishop and then getting back a meager allowance on which to live. Many even believe that the Law of Consecration was repealed and was replaced by Tithing. This is simply not true. The Law of Consecration, as defined above, is God’s command that we voluntarily give all we have to Him so that he can build his kingdom, and we receive great blessings in the process.

                <h5>Everything is God's</h5>
                <p>
                    God created the cosmos, the earth, the plants and animals, our spirits and bodies, and everything that exists. Believing that anything is truly our own is shortsighted and lacking in gratitude to the Supreme Creator. Alma says to Korihor the antichrist, “…all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator” (
                    <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.44">Alma 30:44</a>
                    ). God has given us all that He has, and what He asks in return is that we dedicate what He has given us to building up his kingdom.

                <h5>Stewardship, Agency and Accountability</h5>
                <p>
                    The Law of Consecration is based on stewardship, agency and accountability. The Lord appoints us as stewards over all that he has given us. Over our families, our possessions, our callings, our talents and everything else. We have agency and get to choose how we watch over and care for all that is in our stewardship. Agency implies freedom of choice, but not freedom from consequences. We will be held accountable for how we care for the things in our stewardship both during this life and in the life to come.

                <h5>Temporal Consecration</h5>
                <p>
                    One aspect of the Law of Consecration deals with temporal resources and the care for the poor. When the Lord revealed His law in Doctrine and Covenants 42 He said, “And behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support that which thou hast to impart unto them” (
                    <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.30">30</a>
                    ). He expounds in verse 33 saying, “And again, if there shall be properties in the hands of the church, or any individuals of it, more than is necessary for their support after this first consecration, which is a residue to be consecrated unto the bishop, it shall be kept to administer to those who have not, from time to time, that every man who has need may be amply supplied and receive according to his wants.” (
                    <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.33">33</a>
                    ). The Lord wishes us to voluntarily give of our excess to the poor to meet their needs. He has given us more than we need, not so that we can show off our wealth or live in luxury, but so that we can help those that are less fortunate. He even says that is we have more than we need after helping the poor, we are to give it to the Bishop’s storehouse to be saved up for a time of need. The important promise comes at the end, that our needs may be fulfilled and we will receive according to our wants. Not only will all have enough to satisfy their needs, but those that live the law of consecration will have their wants fulfilled as well.

                <h5>Today</h5>
                <p>
                    To this day the Lord requires his saints to live the law of consecration. In the temple we covenant to keep this law. The church’s pamphlet on preparing for the temple states, “We covenant to give of our resources in time and money and talent—all we are and all we possess—to the interest of the kingdom of God upon the earth” (
                    <a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple?lang=eng">Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple</a>
                    ). We get to choose how much we give, but the Lord requires that we give all.
