                    In July of 1838 Joseph Smith received the revelation on tithing. This revelation was recorded in the 199th section of the Doctrine & Covenants.

                                Verily, thus saith the Lord, I require all their surplus property to be put into the hands of the bishop of my church in Zion,

                            <li>
                                For the building of mine house, and for the laying of the foundation of Zion and for the priesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my Church.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                And this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                And after that, those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Verily I say unto you, it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto the land of Zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties, and shall observe this law, or they shall not be found worthy to abide among you.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                And I say unto you, if my people observe not this law, to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify the land of Zion unto me, that my statutes and my judgments may be kept thereon, that it may be most holy, behold, verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                And this shall be an ensample unto all the stakes of Zion. Even so. Amen.

                    In the first verse the Lord requires that the saints give all of their surplus property to the bishop of the Church. That doesn’t mean just one tenth, but all we have that is more than we need. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In verse four, the revelation states that those who have been “tithed”, or those who have given of their surplus, start paying one tenth of their interest annually, which is a law forever. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Verse five says that when saints gather unto Zion, or join the church, they are to give of their surplus, after which they will give on tenth of their income annually. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tithing is not a replacement of the Law of Consecration, it is simply an additional commandment. The Law of Consecration stands and applies to much more than just temporal possessions. In addition the Lord requires that we give Him one tenth of our increase.
